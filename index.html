This is what gives wine structure and flavor.</p>

            <p class = "text-light">Observe the red color (anthocyanin) changing from more deeper ruby and violet hues to paler red and orange colors. Merlot is actually one of those varieties that’s famous for going orange faster than other red wines (like Cabernet Sauvignon). If you wait long enough, the red pigment will eventually become a dull translucent brown color (like a browned apple).</p>
